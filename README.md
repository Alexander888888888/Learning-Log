# Learning Log

Welcome to my Learning Log! This repository is a record of my journey as I explore, learn, and practice new skills in Web Development and Software enginering.

## Goals

- **Track Progress:** Maintain a clear timeline of what Iâ€™ve learned and achieved.
- **Consolidate Knowledge:** Reinforce understanding by documenting key concepts and lessons.
- **Showcase Growth:** Demonstrate my learning process and skills to potential collaborators or employers.

## How It Works

Each topic folder includes:

1. **README.md:** A brief overview of the topic, key learnings, and resources used.
2. **Code Examples:** Sample code snippets or projects.
3. **Media:** Screenshots, GIFs, or diagrams to visualize concepts where necessary.

## Contents

This repository is organized by topics and areas of study. Please note that as this is an new project there will be limited topics and folders so there won't be much to organise yet but as I learn more I plan to organize it accordingly. Each folder represents a topic, and within each folder, you will find:

- A brief description of what I learned (in Markdown files).
- Examples, small projects, or exercises showcasing practical application.
- Visual aids, such as images or GIFs, where applicable.

### Current Topics

- **Codecademy Projects:** [Codecademy Projects](codecademy%20projects/README.md)
- **Personal Projects:** [Personal Projects](Personal%20Projects/README.md)


## Contributions

## Future Plans

- Explore JavaScript fundamentals and create small, interactive projects.
